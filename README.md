This website is a portfolio based website to show my skills as a Computer Science student. This project allowed for me to gain experience with new
coding languages and understand the fundamentals of them. The skills page shows an estimated bar graph of my coding abilities in percentages. The projects
page brings you to my GitHub profile page where you can view examples of completed codes projects. The resumebutton brings you to a printable document of a 
resume that is consistently updated. View the website [here](https://kdelise.github.io/portfolio-website/)
